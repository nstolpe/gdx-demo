This project is a collections of LibGDX [Screens](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/Screen.html), each demonstrating a feature that can be built with the framework.

### Screens

# [GaussianBlurScreen](core/src/com/hh/gdxtutorial/screens/GaussianBlurShaderScreen.java)
Right now there are demos for a Gaussian blur shader, a multi-pass cel shader, a tilt shift shader, and a turn based engine. You can access these different demos as different screens in the project. Desktop and HTML projects have been tested to work. The Android project is included but hasn't been tested on a device yet.
